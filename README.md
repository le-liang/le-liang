# Hi there, we're [LLGroup](https://liang-seu.net/)
We are a research group led by [Professor Le Liang](https://liang-seu.net/) in the School of Information Science and Engineering, [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), Nanjing, China. We do research in wireless communications and machine learning. The current focus includes:
- **Machine learning in communications and networking** (e.g., MCMC + signal processing, RL/GNN + resource allocation, multi-agent RL)
- **Semantic communications** (e.g., collaborative perception for autonomous driving)
- **Wireless sensing** (e.g., integrated sensing and communications)


To have an idea on what we do on a day-to-day basis, the tools we frequently use in research include
- Deep learning, reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, MCMC
- Communication theory, optimization theory, probability theory, linear algebra
- Python, PyTorch, MATLAB, and (a bit of) C++


ðŸ“£**We are looking for Master's and Ph.D. students who are**:
- Interested in machine learning and wireless communications in general
- Highly motivated with solid mathematics and coding background

We have 1-2 Ph.D. and 3-4 Master's opening each year. Please drop us an email (lliang@seu.edu.cn) if you're interested in working with us.
