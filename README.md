# Hi there, we're [LLGroup](https://liang-seu.net/)
We are a research group in [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), Nanjing, China, led by [Professor Le Liang](https://liang-seu.net/). We do research in the intersection of wireless communications and machine learning, aiming to develop intelligent wireless systems through studying fundamental theory, inventing new algorithms, and building prototypes. Currently, our research is organized around the following three themes:
- **Machine learning in communications and networking** (e.g., MCMC+signal processing, GNN+resource allocation, multi-agent RL)
- **Semantic communications** (e.g., collaborative perception for autonomous driving)
- **Wireless sensing** (e.g., integrated sensing and communications)

For more information, please check out our research website: [https://liang-seu.net/](https://liang-seu.net/)

**We usually have 1-2 Ph.D. and 3-4 Master's opening each year. Please drop us an email (lliang@seu.edu.cn) if you're interested in working with us.**
